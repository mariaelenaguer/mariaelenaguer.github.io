## About me

I am a Ph.D. student at UCLA's economics department. I have a broad interest in development economics questions and I approach these using tools from industrial organization.

Currently, I am working on two projects. In one, I study the welfare effects of a quality regulation policy in the context of higher education in Peru. In the other, I estimate firm-level markups using administrative data from Uganda and explore whether political connections could be a source of market power. I'm also spending considerable time thinking about urbanization processes in Latin America, mostly inspired by [this book](https://www.alishaholland.com/book/). 

Prior to joining UCLA, I was a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at [Yaleâ€™s Tobin Center for Economic Policy](https://tobin.yale.edu/), where I worked with professors [Christopher Neilson](https://christopherneilson.github.io/) and [John Eric Humphries](http://johnerichumphries.com/). Before that, I worked at [IPA](http://www.poverty-action.org/study/information-about-returns-post-primary-education-peru) in Peru, and at [J-PAL LAC](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/latin-america-caribbean) in the Dominican Republic. I received my B.A. in Economics from the _Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru_ in 2018.
